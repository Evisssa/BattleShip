# 🚢  Welcome to Battleship: The Classic Naval Strategy Game! 🌊

Ahoy there, matey! Prepare to embark on an exhilarating journey back in time to the historic origins of Battleship, a game steeped in the annals of naval warfare! Tracing its roots to the First World War, this captivating two-player strategy game has seen the evolution from pencil and paper to the digital era.

Did you know? Milton Bradley, the mastermind behind popularizing the game, introduced Battleship as one of the pioneering computer games in 1979! 🎮

In this thrilling project, we're bringing back this timeless classic! It's time to dust off your strategic prowess and recreate the intense thrill of naval combat.

Before you set sail, let's familiarize ourselves with the rules. The grid is set on a 10x10 game field, where you'll arrange five ships without crossing or touching each other. Remember, these vessels can only be placed horizontally or vertically—no diagonal shenanigans! The ultimate goal? Sink all your opponent's ships before they send yours to Davy Jones' Locker!
